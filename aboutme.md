Hey there! Iâ€™m Stella Yin ðŸ‘‹

Imagine a Data Scientist who not only crunches numbers but tells stories through data. Thatâ€™s me! With my trusty tools Python, R, SQL, TensorFlow, and PyTorch, I delve into data sets like a detective, uncovering insights that drive strategic decisions. Whether it's predictive modeling or deep learning, I bring data to life with engaging visualizations using Tableau and PowerBI, ensuring every data point tells a part of your story.
